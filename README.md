# **Project 9: ZapRecall**

The main goal with this project was to start developing a better understanding of how to control states that will be shared with various react components.

## **Exercised Contents**:

-   Destructuring assignment
-   Spread operator
-   Styled components (globalStyles, keyframes)
-   React Hook (useState, useContext)
-   React Router

## **Results**:

I saw in this project an opportunity to play with stylized components and I took advantage of it. I implemented several animations and, although I didn't create them from scratch, I could better understand how some CSS properties work.
